WHO IS THIS COURSE FOR? 

Aspiring developers - perhaps you learned a little bit of HTML and CSS and want to take your first JavaScript programming course. This course is an ideal starting point.  
Experienced developers with no degree in computer science - there are a lot of self-taught web developers out there who cannot solve basic programming problems, because they never attended a college. Don't be one of those! This course teaches you the fundamental programming skills that every developer must know. 
Anyone who wants to better understand JavaScript - chances are you've taken another course but didn't understand certain topics well. You can take this course to fill the gaps and strengthen your understanding of JavaScript. 
NO PRIOR KNOWLEDGE NEEDED

You don't need familiarity with JavaScript to take this course. You'll learn everything from scratch, step-by-step. A very basic familiarity with HTML will be helpful but it is not required.
